# Image Processing with OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates basic image processing using the OpenCV library. The script performs the following tasks on an input RGB format image:

1. Convert the image to grayscale.
2. Invert the grayscale image.
3. Generate a pencil sketch effect.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the [`main.py`](main.py) file.

2. Place the image you want to process in the same directory as the `main.py` script.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script and the image.

4. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

5. The script will display several windows showing the original image, grayscale image, inverted image, and pencil sketch effect.

6. Press any key to close the windows and exit the script.

## Notes

- Replace `'input_image.jpg'` in the script with the path to your desired input image.

- You can adjust the parameters in the `pencil_sketch` function to control the level of blurring and other effects in the pencil sketch.
